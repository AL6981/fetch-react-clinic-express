## Bikes Fetch in React

Goals:
*   Bikes stored in `bikes.json` should be displayed when the user visits the root path
*   App should include a form that displays on the root path as well
*   Submitting the form should add bikes to the "database"
*   List of bikes on main page should update immediately on form submission, without requiring a page refresh
